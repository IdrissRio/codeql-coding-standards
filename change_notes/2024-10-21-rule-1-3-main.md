 - `RULE-1-3` - `OccurrenceOfUndefinedBehavior.ql`:
   - Improve alert message to report the undefined behavior triggered.
   - Address both false positives and false negatives in identifying standard compliant main methods. Previously, `void main()` was considered permitted and `int main(void)` banned. In addition, we now detect main methods as standard compliant if they use typedefs, and if arrays are used in the definition of `argv`.
