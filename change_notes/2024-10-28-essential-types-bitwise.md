   - False positives and false negatives removed due to fixing incorrect essential type of the binary bitwise operations `^`, `|` and `&`. Previously the standard type was used, instead of applying the essential type rules which dictate that if both arguments have the same signedness, the essential type will have the same signedness and a rank equal to the larger of the two operands.
