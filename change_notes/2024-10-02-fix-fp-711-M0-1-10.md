- `M0-1-10` - `UnusedFunction.ql`:
  - Fixes #711. Excludes constexpr functions, considers functions from GoogleTest as an EntryPoint and does not consider special member functions. Another query called UnusedSplMemberFunction.ql is created that reports unused special member functions. This is done so as to enable deviations to be applied to this case.
