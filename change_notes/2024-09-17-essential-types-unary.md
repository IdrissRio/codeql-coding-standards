 - `RULE-10-1` - `OperandsOfAnInappropriateEssentialType.ql`
   - Reduce false negatives by supporting operands to the `~` operator with the incorrect essential type.
   - Reduce false positives by identifying the essential type of `!<expr>` as essentially boolean type.
   - Improve clarity reporting by reporting the violating operand, instead of the operator, and addressing message typos.
