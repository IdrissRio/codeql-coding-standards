/**
 * A libary for handling "Objects" in C.
 *
 * Objects may be stored in registers or memory, they have an address, a type, a storage duration,
 * and a lifetime (which is different than storage duration). Objects which are structs or arrays
 * have subobjects, which share the storage duration and lifetime of the parent object.
 *
 * Note: lifetime analysis is not performed in this library, but is available in
 * the module `codingstandards.cpp.lifetimes.LifetimeProfile`. In the future, these libraries could
 * be merged for more complete analysis.
 *
 * To get objects in a project, use the `ObjectIdentity` class which finds the following types of
 * objects:
 * - global variables
 * - local variables
 * - literals
 * - malloc calls
 * - certain temporary object expressions
 *
 * And direct references to these objects can be found via the member predicate `getAnAccess()`.
 * However, much of a project's code will not refer to these objects directly, but rather, refer to
 * their subobjects. The class `ObjectIdentity` exposes several member predicates for finding when
 * these subobjects are used:
 * - `getASubobjectType()`
 * - `getASubobjectAccess()`
 * - `getASubobjectAddressExpr()`
 *
 * These methods do not use flow analysis, and will not return a conclusive list of accesses. To
 * get better results here, this library should be integrated with flow analysis or the library
 * `LifetimeProfile.qll`.
 *
 * Additionally, subobjects are currently not tracked individually. In the future subobjects could
 * be tracked as a root object and an access chain to refer to them. For now, however, finding *any*
 * subobject access is sufficient for many analyses.
 *
 * To get the storage duration, `ObjectIdentity` exposes the member predicate
 * `getStorageDuration()` with the following options:
 * - `obj.getStorageDuration().isAutomatic()`: Stack objects
 * - `obj.getStorageDuration().isStatic()`: Global objects
 * - `obj.getStorageDuration().isThread()`: Threadlocal objects
 * - `obj.getStorageDuration().isAllocated()`: Dynamic objects
 *
 * Note that lifetimes are not storage durations. The only lifetime tracking currently implemented
 * is `hasTemporaryLifetime()`, which is a subset of automatic storage duration objects, and may
 * be filtered out, or selected directly with `TemporaryObjectIdentity`.
